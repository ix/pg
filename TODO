feat:
	- basic search
	- regex search (iffy)
	- line number display mode
	- escape sequences toggle

fix:
	- don't segv on large files
	- don't segv on scroll-down of one-line file
	- don't mess up with lines longer than terminal window
	- don't restore cursor position on exit if alternate buffer is not
	  supported by terminal (this starts to get into the realm of
	  terminal control libraries. obviously we want to avoid (n)curses
	  and similarly huge softwares, so let's explore our possibilities
	  here.)
